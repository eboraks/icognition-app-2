                collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. 
                As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your 
                choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will 
                inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
